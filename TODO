- Check @cpt_flags usage, especially used in fd descriptors and file descriptors
- stubs for IPC part, completely
- stubs for fanotify, socket queues, remap files, namespaces files (ie /proc/ns:[])
- sockets filters
- netdevice, only lo supported
- no timers (not yet implemented in criu)
- no locked termios in cpt image
- iptables data
- routing need to be revisited
- while there is eventqueue in openvz, no such thing in criu, ignoring
- inodes referred to deleted files may have undelied path dump (see dump_one_inode in openvz source code)
- also there are following undelied data in inodes: tty ref, regular files content (including shmem,shm)
- convert CPT_OBJ_SIGNAL_STRUCT, CPT_OBJ_LASTSIGINFO, CPT_OBJ_SIGALTSTACK, CPT_OBJ_SIGINFO if needed
- need to check CLONE_ flags used in criu and here, openvz kernel use different
  methods for flags retrieval from the image (see kernel's make_baby() call)
- sysv shared memory is not yet converted
- criu doesn't use CPT_OBJ_LASTSIGINFO
